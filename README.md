# IPL MANAGER WEB APP
This web application allows cricket fanatics to put themselves in the shoes of team owners in the Indian Premier League. Users can make hypothetical player trades with other teams, build squads from scratch through the IPL Auction Simulator, and build hypothetical starting 11s with their original/new squads. Such an application has never been developed before!
